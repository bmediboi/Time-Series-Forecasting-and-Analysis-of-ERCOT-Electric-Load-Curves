## Electric Load Curve Analysis of ERCOT Data

### Project Overview
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of electrical load curves from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), aiming to forecast power grid load demands to ensure a stable and efficient power supply. Spanning data from 2002 to 2023, the analysis covers eight distinct zones across Texas, employing advanced time series techniques such as deterministic trend modeling and ARIMA to achieve robust forecasting outcomes.

### Data
The dataset utilized for this project comprises comprehensive load curve data from ERCOT, segmented by zones within Texas over the period from 2002 to 2023. To enhance the quality of insights, data preprocessing steps included aggregation at weekly and monthly intervals, facilitating thorough examination and interpretation.

### Results
By leveraging time series methodologies, the project delivers highly accurate power demand forecasts. Key performance indicators, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), were utilized to rigorously evaluate forecast accuracy against observed data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the applied models.
